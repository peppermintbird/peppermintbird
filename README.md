# Hi there! Welcome aboard! 🍬🐦

I'm Ray, a data science and language enthusiast. Welcome to my corner of the coding dimension!

## 🌱 About Me

- 📚 Studying Data Science and Foreign Languages. Exploring spiking neural networks and computational neuroscience.
- 🌐 Struggling to contribute to the open-source projects [snnTorch](https://github.com/jeshraghian/snntorch) and [Open MCT](https://github.com/nasa/openmct) -- those folks are really brilliant.
- 🌍 Interested in climate and astronomical research, and neuromorphic systems.
